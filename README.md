# EAS PULSE

EAS Pulse is a free, and open-source analytics platform that makes Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) data comprehensible, transparent, and actionable for everyone ‚Äì from developers building the next generation of trust infrastructure to analysts tracking ecosystem growth. 

## üåü What Makes Us Different  

Born from a hackathon project at ETHGlobal‚Äôs SuperHack 2024, EAS Pulse has evolved into the analytics backbone for one of Ethereum‚Äôs most promising primitives. We are building the data infrastructure that helps the entire EAS ecosystem understand adoption patterns, identify opportunities, and make informed decisions.

##¬†üìä Why EAS Pulse Matters 

Ethereum Attestation Service represents a paradigm shift in how we establish trust and verify claims. Yet without clear visibility into how attestations are being used across chains and applications, the ecosystem operates in the dark. 

EAS Pulse solves this by:

* Visualizing adoption trends across networks and attestors 
* Revealing opportunities 
* Enabling open data reuse, with every query publicly forkable on GitHub and Dune 
* Promoting transparency in projects using EAS (e.g., Coinbase Verifications, Human Passport, and others) 
* Supporting innovation by helping projects understand what‚Äôs working and where gaps exist

## üöÄ Impact & Traction 

Since launching, we‚Äôve become a trusted resource for the EAS community:  

* 10k+ monthly API calls from developers and analysts 
* 220+ followers on X engaging with our insights 
* 160+ stars on Dune Analytics, demonstrating data analysts' adoption 
* Participated in Gitcoin GG22 Hackathon Alumni and GG23 Developer Tooling rounds

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
